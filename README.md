# coding-events-demo - THis is an app designed to allow a user o create, add and search events makign a sql database to store it
A person cass does not currently exist however would require a unique identifier, a first name last name, comapany name, email and password to acess it
Ideally it would allow a person to sign up and select which events it is interested, so a List of favortie events and a list of events signed up could be usefull also
You couls also have it email the person with confirmations of events ans suggest similar events to what has already been selected
